# datatools

I made this program for my entrance into codeup, I was working with dataframes and had very little understanding 
of pandas at the time, it mostly converts dataframes to dictionaries and works with them from there, I find the filter_data() function to be quite useful and use it occasionaly to filter through multiple values
